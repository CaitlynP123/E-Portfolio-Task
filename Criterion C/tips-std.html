					<h2>2. Play the role of a Peacekeeper</h2>			
					<p>Another way students can deal with conflicts, is to have measures set to prevent
						the conflict beforehand. They can assing the role of a 'peacekeeper' or 'mediator'
						to 1-2 people on the group, so if tension starts building up, they can deal with it 
						fast. 
					</p>
					
					<h4>Somethings a peacekeeper can do:</h4>
					<ul>
						<li><p>Try to stop the conflict before it escalates, keep the situation small</p></li>
						<li><p>Divide the conflicting parties, and ask them to work on seperate tasks</p></li>
						<li><p>Hear all sides of the story, and make a decision about what to do next</p></li>
						<li><p>Keep the atmosphere fun - when people are stressed they tend to get snappy 
							and irritated faster, so its best to ensure everyone stays cool, calm and collected
						</p></li>
					</ul>
		
					<p>
						Though its important to remember the wellbeing of the group shouldn't solely depend on the 
						peacekeeper, each member needs to cooperate for them to communicate well and be productive.

					<h2>3. Divide and Conquer</h2>			
					<p>
						A pretty big problem in group tasks is that sometimes there are too many group members
						and the situation becomes chaotic and unproductive. There's yelling, shouting, arguing
						and no place for productivity. The best course of action in this case is to further 
						divide the group into smaller groups and break down the task, so everyone works faster
						and more efficiently. 
						<br>
						<br>
						This is also a really effective technique when there are conflicting parties;
						breaking them up and making them focus on their work saves time and just makes
						the entire group experience much easier

					<h4>Requirements for a constructive debate</h4>
					<ul>
						<li><p>Keep it friendly, present your point and don't take digs at anyone else</p></li>
						<li><p>If you have enough team members, keep 1-2 people away from the debate and as neutral parties so they can decide whos argument was more convincing</p></li>
						<li><p>Keep it on a timer, don't get too carried away, you still have a task to finish!</p></li>
						<li><p>When the debate is done, accept the outcome and participate actively, avoid wasting time on pettiness</p></li>
