				<h2>Understanding and Communicating</h2>			
				<p>
					When 2 or more students are fighting, as a teacher you should calm both the students down
					and hear their perspectives. Once you've formed an understanding of the situation, explain 
					to each child what the other was saying. Sometimes students can find it difficult to express
					themselves, as an adult you may find it easier to interpret their actions and behaviours, so
					you'll be a good mediator for the conflicting parties.  
				</p>

						<h4>Keep in mind</h4>
						<ul>
							<li><p>Most conflicts students can be dealt with quickly, students can tend to be a tad bit dramatic and blow things out of proportion</p></li>
							<li><p>Students need to recognize their fault in the conflict, help them address it and apologize for it</p></li>
							<li><p>Make sure that the students feel heard, and don't force them to apologize, if they aren't sincere all your efforts are pointless</p></li>
						</ul>

						<h4>Ask students things like</h4>
						<ul>
							<li><p>Why are you fighting with *student name*, what have they done?</p></li>
							<li><p>How did you react, what did you say?</p></li>
							<li><p>What are you feeling right now and why do you think you're feeling this way?</p></li>
							<li><p>What would you like *student name* to do?</p></li>
							<li><p>Do you feel like you should apologize for anything you've said?</p></li>

			<h2>Activities</h2>			
			<p>
				One of the most effective way to deal with fights is to have children do a small activity. 
				This approach works best for students in elementary years, high schoolers and middle schoolers
				may find it better to just talk it out but 4th and 5th graders will jump at the chance to do
				an activity. There are many worksheets one can find online or you could ask students to write
				what they think and feel down on a paper and share it with other students.
