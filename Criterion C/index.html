                <br>
                <p>
                    Conflict can be defiend as a disagreement between 2 or more parties. They can be caused by
                    multiple things, but the best way to deal with them is through effective negotiation and 
                    conflict management. <b>Conflict resolution can simply be defined as the means by which 2 
                    or more parties solve a problem or conflict they are facing. </b>The aim of conflict 
                    resolution is to solve a disagreement peacefully and in a way that benefits all parties 
                    involved.

                <h1>Why is it important</h1>
                <p>
                    Being able to resolve conflicts is a really important skill, especially in group tasks. 
                    There are many instances in group tasks where the team members fight due to disagreements 
                    over plans and decisions, unequal participation from team members, etc. The issue with 
                    these fights is that they waste a lot of valuable time and reduce team morale and 
                    productivity. Having conflict resolution skills, and knowing how to deal with these 
                    problems is incredibly helpful, because they allow the team members to solve and avoid 
                    conflicts, while maintaining productivity and working together efficiently.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Developing your conflict resolution skills improves your communication skills and your 
                    social skills. Having these skills are also a big part of being a good leader, and they 
                    aren't only valuable in school settings, many companies look for good conflict resolution 
                    skills especially while recruiting managers.
