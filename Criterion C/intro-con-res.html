                                <p>
                                    Group tasks are a pretty big part of our school years. There are a lot of times 
                                    students are grouped up may it be for assignments or planning events. Participating in 
                                    group tasks can improve one's communication and social skills and makes them better at 
                                    collaboration. Working as a group, even for a small assignment, can expose a student 
                                    to multiple new ideas and perspectives, and some students may even find that they 
                                    learn things faster when fellow students help them.

                                    With social media and platforms like Zoom, Google Meet or file-sharing platforms like 
                                    Google Docs and Google Slides, students are finding it easier to collaborate and 
                                    learn together. Group tasks are not only helpful but they can be really fun as well, 
                                    especially when you work with your peers; you get to be productive while hanging out 
                                    with your friends!

                        <h1>Causes of conflict in group tasks</h1>
                        <p>
                            Group tasks are really helpful, but with all things in life, there are certain issues
                            students can face while participating in group tasks. The nemesis of productivity -
                            conflicts.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Conflicts are just disagreements between 2 or more parties. They can be physical or verbal,
                            but either way, they're a nuisance, especially in group tasks. Petty arguments and
                            disagreements can waste a lot of valuable time, and affect the overall performance of 
                            the group.

                                <li>Issues with appointed group leaders</li>
                                <li>Other preexisting conflicts (e.g. 2 people who just REALLY hate each other in one group, yikes)</li>
                                <li>Differences in opinion and perspective</li>
                                <li>Disagreements over how to execute the task, which can be caused by lack of information about the task</li>
                                <li>Grouphate - Dislike towards working in a group and lacking the motivation to participate</li>

                    <h1>Importance of dealing with conflicts effectively</h1>
                    <p>
                        As mentioned previously, conflicts are just unecessarily time consuming and could 
                        lead to petty insults and arguments or could even escalate as far to physical conflicts.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        No one should have to lose their chance at a good grade or performance just because of 
                        chaos in a group. Which is why, learning conflict resolution skills is really important. 
                        If students know how to deal with fights independently they can work more efficiently 
                        and communicate with their group mates better. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Conflict resolution skills won't only help at school, but in any situation where stuff's 
                        going down. It can prove to be really useful in corporate settings, because good conflict
                        management skills are viewed as a big part of being a good leader, so managers especially
                        require good conflict managemen skills
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        But, you can think about all that later, right now, you should focus on getting those
                        two group members to stop bickering about who's right and finish your assignment!
