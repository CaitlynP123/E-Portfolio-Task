					<h2 style="font-size: 45px; margin-left: 20px;">1. The Lord of the Flies Conch</h2>
					<div class="description">
						<p>
							<b>Description: </b>
							The Lord of the Flies is a fairly famous book about a group of British School boys stranded
							on an island, trying to survive and govern themselves. At one point in the book, the boys
							pick up a conch and decide that whenever they need to make a decision or declare something,
							one of them will hold the conch and speak, while the others wait for their chance at the conch
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							Similarly, when facing troubles in groups, what students can do is, take an object, which can
							be anything from a water bottle to an eraser, and take turns to speak their point of view, before
							rationally planning out and deciding the course of action
						</p>
					</div>						
					<div class="obj">
						<p>
							<b>Objective: </b>
							Students take turns to speak their point of view and listen to other before collaborating 
							and finding a solution that fits the situation best	
						</p>
					</div>
					<br>
					<div class="time">
						<p>
							<b>Time: </b>
							Roughly 5-15 mins, each student should get to speak for around 1-2 mins, to save time. 
							It's also important for students to remember to keep it civil and respect each other

					<h2 style="font-size: 45px; margin-left: 20px;">2. Freaky Friday</h2>
					<div class="description">
						<p>
							<b>Description: </b>In the unlikely event you haven't watched Freaky Friday I'll briefly 
							explain what it's about. Tt's a movie about a mother and daughter, who are very different 
							people, end up having their bodies switched and they have to live as one another until 
							they find asolution. By being in each others shoe's they  were able to develop a new 
							respect andunderstanding of one another. Which brings us to the activity <b> 2 or more 
							parties who are having a fight have to act in the situation as the person they're fighting 
							with.</b>
						</p>	
					</div>
					<br>
					<div class="obj">
						<p>
							<b>Objective: </b>
							The objective of the game is to try and put oneself in another persons shoes and 
							understand their perspective and what they may be feeling, by acting as them in 
							the situation. It's also an opportuniy for one to reflect on their actions and 
							how they impact other people. The main aim to come to a decision that benefits 
							everyone involved 
						</p>
					</div>
					<br>
					<div class="time">
						<p>
							<b>Time Required: </b> Roughly 10 to 30 mins depending on the severity of 
							complexity of the conflict (I recommend keeping it short so you don't waste too 
							much time)
						</p>

			<div class="gdiv" style="display: flex;">
				<div class="txt">
					<div class="description">
						<p>
							<b>Description: </b>
							One of my main advices while dealing with conflict is to separate the conflicting parties
							but for this activity, you need to pair them up together. The aim of this activity is to 
							take a rope and tie 2 peoples hands together so that they have one free working hand, but
							they need to collaborate and function as a unit to be productive.   	
							<br><br>
							Now personally I don't recommend this method if you need to be wary of deadlines, but if members
							have time, and a few members in particular are being annoying, it's a fun way to solve the conflict
							and force people to work together. You're essentially restricting the problem to the conflicting parties,
							leaving them to solve it alone while the rest continue with their work
		
						</p>

					<br>
					<div class="obj">
						<p>
							<b>Objective: </b>
							Forcing 2 conflicting parties to collaborate by tying their hands together, so that they overcome 
							their conflict and work together as one unit.

					<br>
					<div class="time">
						<p>
							<b>Time: </b>
							Really depends on the duration of the task and the attitudes of the members
